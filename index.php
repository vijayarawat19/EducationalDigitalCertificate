                <p id="paragarph">As education becomes more diversified ,decentralized, we still need to maintain trust and repuatation in certification, and proof of learning.The increased focus on relevance and employability may also push us in this drection, as we also need transparency. Blockchain could provide just such a system:a transparent ,online ,secure certification system.We can build an ecosystem for accessing the candidates, and granting and verifying blockchain based educational certifications. Digital certificate are registered on the Ethereum blockchain,cryptographically signed, and tamper proof.The project provides facilities like
				and profile creation of students thus reducing paperwork and automating the record 
				generation process in an educational institution. 
				Digital certificates 
				can be used by education institutes to 
				maintain the records of students easily. Achieving this objective is difficult using a 
				manual system as the information is scattered, can be redundant and collecting relevant 
				information may be very time consuming. All these problems are solved using this project.
